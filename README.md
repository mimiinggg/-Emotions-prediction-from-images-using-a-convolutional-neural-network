# -Emotions-classification-from-images-using-a-convolutional-neural-network
Develop a complete cognitive computing system in Python that can classify the emotion that a person is experiencing based on a photograph of the personâ€™s face using convolutional neural network model (CNN).

Used framework Tensorflow and API Keras.

Trained CNN through different optimizers, loss functions, and metrics, then use ROC curves and confusion matrices to validate the best model for the classification.
